1. Even if it doesn't, saying “I googled on the following phrase but didn't get anything that looked promising” is a good thing to do in e-mail or news postings requesting help.

2. Super User is for questions about general-purpose computing. Stack Overflow is for questions about programming. Server Fault is for questions about server and network administration.

3. In IRC, it's probably best not to dump a long problem description on the channel first thing; some people interpret this as channel-flooding. Best to utter a one-line problem description in a way pitched to start a conversation on the channel.

4. Don't assume that the mailing list doesn't exist. Mention in your e-mail that you tried and could not find the appropriate mailing list. Also mention that you don't object to having your message forwarded to other people.

5. One good convention for subject headers, used by many tech support organizations, is “object - deviation”. The “object” part specifies what thing or group of things is having a problem, and the “deviation” part describes the deviation from expected behavior.

6. It doesn't have to be stiff or formal — in fact, hacker culture values informal, slangy and humorous language used with precision. But it has to be precise.

7. If you are writing in English but it is a second language for you, it is good form to alert potential respondents to potential language difficulties and options for getting around them.

* English is not my native language; please excuse typing errors.

* If you speak $LANGUAGE, please email/PM me; I may need assistance translating my question.

* I am familiar with the technical terms, but some slang expressions and idioms are difficult for me.

* I've posted my question in $LANGUAGE and English. I'll be glad to translate responses, if you only use one or the other.

* Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.

Describe the environment in which it occurs,Provide your vendor's distribution and release level.

Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.

Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question.

Describe any possibly relevant recent changes in your computer or software configuration.

If at all possible, provide a way to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment.

* It's not useful to tell hackers what you think is causing your problem. Make sure you're telling them the raw symptoms of what goes wrong, rather than your interpretations and theories.

* People who need technical help have a high-level goal in mind and get stuck on what they think is one particular path towards the goal. They come for help with the step, but don't realize that the path is wrong. 

* E-mail me and I'll summarize the answers for the group

* Posting a dozen lines of code, saying "after line 7 I was expecting to see <x>, but <y> occurred instead" is much more likely to get you a response.

* Send a note after the problem has been solved to all who helped you.

* If you're after information rather than entertainment, it's better to keep your fingers off the keyboard than to risk this.

*
